# Hello World â€“ Cloud Run Flask App
This is a minimal Python Flask application deployed using Google Cloud Run. It simply returns a customizable "Hello Finnegan" message. <br>
Live demo available upon request.

I have also added a basic CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments. As of the current version, it checks if the site displays "Hello Finnegan bro!". If not, the workflow run in the actions tab will display an error.
